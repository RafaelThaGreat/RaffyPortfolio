### About Me

![alt text](https://github.com/RafaelThaGreat/RaffyPortfolio/blob/master/42996816_10215130153840703_2394711186852544512_n.jpg "Me 'Raff' and my wife 'Milky'")

I am 32 year old guy living in USA and Thailand (20%/80%), with my beautiful wife. I love programming and electronics and eating good food. I really like to travel around Asia and the rest of the world. I feel like traveling is the greatest way to gain wisdom and culture and programming is the vehicle that makes everything possible.
